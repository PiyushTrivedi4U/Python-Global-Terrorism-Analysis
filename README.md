# Global Terrorism Dataset Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) from 1970 to 2017 using Python. The GTD is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2017. This README file serves as a guide to understanding the structure of the project and how to reproduce the analysis.

## Dataset
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) used in this project can be obtained from START - National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. The dataset contains detailed information on terrorist attacks worldwide, including location, date, weapons used, casualties, and perpetrators, among other variables.

## Requirements
To run the analysis, you need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Plotly
- Codecs


## Analysis
The EDA covers various aspects of the GTD dataset, including:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Statistical summaries and distributions of key variables.
- Temporal analysis of terrorist incidents.
- Geographic analysis using maps.
- Analysis of attack types, weapons used, and casualties.
- Examination of trends and patterns over time.
